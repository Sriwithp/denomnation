# denomination

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Flutter Denomination app by using Hive package.

By using this app we will tally denomination. User firstly need to enter the total amount then denomination count. if the user entered amount and denomination total amount is equal the denomination table turn into teal color, if it's not same the table will be in red color. and also convert denomination table amount into word format.\

And users also save the denomination history bypressing save button and view by pressing history icon.\
I used HIVE package for local data storage
